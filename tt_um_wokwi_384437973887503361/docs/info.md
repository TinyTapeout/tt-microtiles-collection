## How it works

The Project is a Asynchronous 3 Bit Down Counter.In the asynchronous counter, an external clock pulse is provided for only the first Flip-Flop, thereafter the output of the 1st Flip-Flop acts as a clock pulse for the second Flip-Flop and so on. In the case of synchronous Flip-Flops, all 
the Flip-Flops are triggered simultaneously by an external clock pulse.

## How to test

Pressing the button in succession will make the counter count.
