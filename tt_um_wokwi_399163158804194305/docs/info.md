## How it works
A value is placed in the inputs from 0 to 7 to define how much it counts. Then, the start input is set to 1 to load that value, and it begins to count. When it reaches zero, the end flag is raised.

## How to test



## External hardware

It is recommended to use switches for the inputs, a button for the start input, and LEDs for all the outputs.
