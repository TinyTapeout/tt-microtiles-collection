# Keypad Decoder for Tiny Tapeout 6

A keypad scanner similar to the standard chips like 74C922, ADP5586, or LM8330, but much simpler. \
It is just an experimental and educational project.

## Simulation

A digital simulation of the project can be viewed and tried in this [Wokwi simulator](https://wokwi.com/projects/394618582085551105).
